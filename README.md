# MetS-Calculator
Metabolic Syndrome Severity Score (MetS) Calculator
This is my first coding project, so the code is quite messy, but here is a screenshot of the calculator.

Based on the gender, as well as SCP, FPG,SC, HDL and TG scores, these scores are being converted into the appropriate units, then the MetS score is calculated based on a the formula.
THe calculator is  being used by a medical research team of 5 to calculate MetS scores in their data collection process.
